This includes our telephone Money Advice Line, face-to-face appointment service and the Money Advice Service website including the \u2018web-chat\u2019 facility. </p><p>This policy together with our website <a title=\"Terms and conditions\" href=\"terms-and-conditions\">terms and conditions</a> sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide us with, will be processed by us or our delivery partners. </p><p>Any information you provide will be treated in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. We will not try to sell you anything and you won\u2019t receive unsolicited telephone calls or mail from us or any third parties as a result of personal data being provided to us. Your information may solely be used for quality, training and evaluation purposes, to help us monitor and improve the Money Advice Service, or to provide services you have requested (such as an order for printed publications, or a telephone or face-to-face appointment). By using the Money Advice Service website and submitting your information to us, you agree to us using your personal information in accordance with this policy. </p><p>Please notify us by email to <a title=\"Enquiries inbox\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:enquiries@moneyadviceservice.org.uk\">enquiries@moneyadviceservice.org.uk</a> if you have provided us with personal information and you do not wish it to be used as described below, or you wish to see which information we hold about you as a result of your contact with us. </p><h2>What will we do with your personal information? </h2><h3>If you talk to us face to face, via web-chat or on the phone </h3><p>We will use your personal information to provide you with any information or advice that you ask for, to reply to any correspondence and to manage the service that we provide. Nothing else. We use aggregated non personal user data to analyse information such as where in the country users come from, what type of questions they are asking, and whether we were able to give them information or advice that was useful. Sometimes we ask independent organisations to undertake this work for us. There is nothing in this data from which a user\u2019s identity can be ascertained. </p><p>At times, we also want to hear users\u2019 views on the Money Advice Service and any improvements they might suggest and we commission independent research agencies to ascertain user\u2019s reactions and opinions. If you agree, and only if you agree to help us with this, then we will pass on your contact details to a research agency so that they can get in touch with you to see if you would like to engage in further research. Neither we nor our appointed agency will try to sell you anything. </p><h3>If you use the Money Advice Service website </h3><p>Subject to legal requirements in place from time to time, your IP address and session information are only used for system administration and to provide statistics, which we use to evaluate use of the site. Please see our <a title=\"Cookie guide\" href=\"cookie-guide\">Cookie guide</a> for more detail. </p><p>If you provide us with your contact or address details using one of our online forms we will only use this information to deliver the services you have requested. </p><p>If we would like to use your personal information for any other purpose than those stated above, we will contact you to ask for your consent before doing so. </p><h2>Who will see your information? </h2><h3>If you talk to us face to face, via web-chat on the phone </h3><p>All personal information will be fully protected in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and will be held confidentially. The only people with access to it will be those initially providing the advice and information to you and those involved in providing, evaluating or managing the Money Advice Service. This policy does not cover any other service that we may refer you to in order to complete your enquiry. </p><h3>If you use the Money Advice Service website </h3><p>If you requested printed material (such as a Money Advice Service guide or the Parent\u2019s guide to money), we use third parties to provide these services, so your information will be passed on to them for this purpose only. They will not pass your information on to anyone else or use it for any other purpose. </p><p>We may pass on your personal information if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply our website terms and conditions or for the purposes of the prevention or detection of a crime. </p><h2>How do we protect your personal information? </h2><p>The Money Advice Service makes every effort (through physical, organisational and technological measures) to ensure that your personal information is held securely and to safeguard against unauthorised access to your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We strive to protect your personal information after we\u2019ve received it, however you acknowledge that the privacy of your communications and personal information can never be completely guaranteed when it is being transmitted. </p><h2>Changes to this policy </h2><p>Please note that this policy may change from time to time and the new privacy policy will be published on the Money Advice Service website. Regularly reviewing this page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties. </p>"}
